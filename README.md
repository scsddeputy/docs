Mixer
---------------

You can allows users to sign in on your community with their Mixer account. This is a great way to make it easier for users to get started on your community and increase the number of signups, especially if the subject of your community means your users are likely to have Mixer accounts. This guide covers everything you need to know to set up this integration.

### Create OAuth App

1. Visit [Mixer Lab](https://mixer.com/lab) and sign in with your Mixer account if not already signed in.

2. Click the OAuth Clients Link under the logo

4. Fill in the form with your community information

- Name can be anything you want (Will show on the Authorize Page)
- Website is the redirect url for your site and should be filled out as shown: http://your-url.com/applications/core/interface/mixer/auth.php. Replace 'your-url' with the address of your community. If you use https, change it in the url to https.

### Link with Site

You may also fetch a file. In this example, this fetches the file `Readme.md` in
the same folder as the HTML file.

``` javascript
Flatdoc.run({
  fetcher: Flatdoc.file('Readme.md')
});
```

You may actually supply any URL here. It will be fetched via AJAX. This is
useful for local testing.

``` javascript
Flatdoc.run({
  fetcher: Flatdoc.file('http://yoursite.com/Readme.md')
});
```

How it works
------------

Flatdoc is a hosted `.js` file (along with a theme and its assets) that you can
add into any page hosted anywhere.

#### All client-side

There are no build scripts or 3rd-party services involved. Everything is done in
the browser. Worried about performance? Oh, It's pretty fast.

Flatdoc utilizes the [GitHub API] to fetch your project's Readme files. You may
also configure it to fetch any arbitrary URL via AJAX.

#### Lightning-fast parsing

Next, it uses [marked], an extremely fast Markdown parser that has support for
GitHub flavored Markdown.

Flatdoc then simply renders *menu* and *content* DOM elements to your HTML
document. Flatdoc also comes with a default theme to style your page for you, or
you may opt to create your own styles.

Markdown extras
---------------

Flatdoc offers a few harmless, unobtrusive extras that come in handy in building
documentation sites.

#### Code highlighting

You can use Markdown code fences to make syntax-highlighted text. Simply
surround your text with three backticks. This works in GitHub as well.
See [GitHub Syntax Highlighting][fences] for more info.

    ``` html
    <strong>Hola, mundo</strong>
    ```

#### Blockquotes

Blockquotes show up as side figures. This is useful for providing side
information or non-code examples.

> Blockquotes are blocks that begin with `>`.

#### Smart quotes

Single quotes, double quotes, and double-hyphens are automatically replaced to
their typographically-accurate equivalent. This, of course, does not apply to
`<code>` and `<pre>` blocks to leave code alone.

> "From a certain point onward there is no longer any turning back. That is the
> point that must be reached."  
> --Franz Kafka

#### Buttons

If your link text has a `>` at the end (for instance: `Continue >`), they show
up as buttons.

Misc

Inspirations
------------

The following projects have inspired Flatdoc.

 * [Backbone.js] - Jeremy's projects have always adopted this "one page
 documentation" approach which I really love.

 * [Docco] - Jeremy's Docco introduced me to the world of literate programming,
 and side-by-side documentation in general.

 * [Stripe] - Flatdoc took inspiration on the look of their API documentation.

 * [DocumentUp] - This service has the same idea but does a hosted readme 
 parsing approach.
